Somehow, his long hitting and short attention span carried him to victory Sunday at the most buttoned-down of majors, on a course that requires the mental concentration of an illusionist. Extricating himself from more tight spots than David Blaine, Watson overcame a four-stroke deficit in the final 16 holes of the 76th Masters to force a playoff with his final-round partner, Louis Oosthuizen.", "abstract": "Bubba Watson wins the Masters golf tournament, his first major championship; defeats Louis Oosthuizen on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff.
