''Grass's poems fan the flames of hatred against Israel and the Israeli people, thus promoting the idea he was part of when he donned an SS uniform,'' said the minister, Eli Yishai, referring to Mr. Grass's admission that he had been a Nazi soldier as a 17-year-old. ''His distorted poems are not welcome in Israel. I suggest he try them in Iran where he will find a sympathetic audience.''", "abstract": "Israel's interior minister Eli Yishai says that Gunter Grass, a well-known German author, is not welcome in the country because of his controversial poem about the region's nuclear crisis that accused Israel of being a threat to world peace.
