And a maze of conflicting health care and immigration policies meant that while the government would pay for a lifetime of dialysis, costing $75,000 yearly, it would not pay for a $100,000 transplant that would make dialysis unnecessary.", "abstract": null, "print_page": "15", "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2012/04/07/nyregion/07transplant2/07transplant2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2012/04/07/nyregion/07transplant2/07transplant2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg"}, "type": "image", "height": 75}, {"subtype": "xlarge", "url": "images/2012/04/07/nyregion/07transplant2/07transplant2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "height": 330, "width": 600, "legacy": {"xlargewidth": 600, "hasxlarge": "Y", "xlarge": "images/2012/04/07/nyregion/07transplant2/07transplant2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "xlargeheight": 330}, "type": "image"}], "headline": {"main": "From Brother to Brother, a Kidney, and a Life"}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DIALYSIS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRANSPLANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SURGERY AND SURGEONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KIDNEYS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS"}], "pub_date": "2012-04-07T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "section_name": "Health; New York and Region", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Nina", "lastname": "BERNSTEIN"}], "original": "By NINA BERNSTEIN"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd100a18eb7c8105d5bb75e", "word_count": 1154, "slideshow_credits": null}
