It was a big deal for fans of that reclusive British art-rock singer. Despite releasing records more or less steadily over the years, Ms. Bush has never performed a concert in the United States. And she hasn't toured anywhere, singing in public only rarely since a one-month string of European shows in 1979.", "abstract": null, "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "A Singer of Art-Rock and Bach (He's a Yodeler, Too)"}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BLECKMANN, THEO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "pub_date": "2012-04-05T00:00:00Z", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "section_name": "Arts", "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "firstname": "Will", "lastname": "HERMES"}], "original": "By WILL HERMES"}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "4fd100a18eb7c8105d5bb6b2", "word_count": 1130, "slideshow_credits": null}
