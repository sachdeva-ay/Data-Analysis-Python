It\u2019s the work of the Brooklyn-based, largely Juilliard-trained dance-and-acrobatics ensemble Company XIV. On a proscenium framed by heavy red curtains, with candelabra where the footlights would usually be, Tchaikovsky\u2019s darling little Clara (a radiant Laura Careless) is a mini-Marie Antoinette with a comeuppance in store, to be delivered by Drosselmeyer, her godfather, played like a smarmy satyr pimp by Jeff Takacs. The genius of this production, which includes eye-dazzling physical feats performed on giant hula hoops and from silken swings, is its transformation of traditional ballet into louche vaudeville: the famous Spanish dance becomes a foot-stomping, castanet-clicking striptease; in the storied Kingdom of the Sweets, Clara wields a fat black whip to play gleeful dominatrix over a troupe of bare-bottomed, harnessed Licorice Boys.", "abstract": "It\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s more astonishing about \u201cNutcracker Rouge,\u201d an irreverent restaging of the holiday classic \u2014 its virtuosity or its bawdiness.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "After Hours | An NC-17 Retelling of \u2018The Nutcracker\u2019", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}, {"rank": "2", "name": "subject", "value": "Dancing"}, {"rank": "3", "name": "organizations", "value": "Minetta Lane Theater"}, {"rank": "4", "name": "glocations", "value": "Greenwich Village (Manhattan, NY)"}], "pub_date": "2013-12-09T14:00:10Z", "document_type": "blogpost", "news_desk": null, "section_name": null, "subsection_name": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "firstname": "Tim", "rank": 1, "lastname": "MURPHY"}], "original": "By TIM MURPHY"}, "type_of_material": "Blog", "_id": "54ee201938f0d85e5cb21f80", "word_count": "314", "slideshow_credits": null}
