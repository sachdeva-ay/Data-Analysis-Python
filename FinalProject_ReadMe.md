# Analysis 1

#### Using **AirBnb** User Sessions Dataset, in the first Analysis 1 have tried and showed how users do the activities after creating an account. 

#### I have converted a .txt file to a csv datafile for a cleaner look. The data set provides with information for when was the account created, which device wwas used, if there was a booking done or if the user just did some searching but did not book.
#### It also shows how many time the user has visited the site and for how many minuted hat particular session lasted and what were his activities during that.

#### This graph over here explains us that many of the users, even if they have spent like 600 minutes or more have not made a booking. Indeed it is a sign that it takes a lot of time to plan and book a vacation.
#### Most of the people in this have just seached Airbnb for a place but not booking.

But what are the users on all those devices doing during the sessions? The data provides information on 3 important actions: searching, sending messages, and requesting a booking

What's actually interesting is to see how user actions translate into user outcomes. Below is a high level summary of users' average session durations, days online, and achieved user outcomes:
