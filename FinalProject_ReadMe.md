# Analysis 1

#### Using **AirBnb** User Sessions Dataset, in the first Analysis 1 have tried and showed how users do the activities after creating an account. 

#### I have converted a .txt file to a csv datafile for a cleaner look. The data set provides with information for when was the account created, which device wwas used, if there was a booking done or if the user just did some searching but did not book.
#### It also shows how many time the user has visited the site and for how many minuted hat particular session lasted and what were his activities during that.

#### This graph over here explains us that many of the users, even if they have spent like 600 minutes or more have not made a booking. Indeed it is a sign that it takes a lot of time to plan and book a vacation.
#### Most of the people in this have just seached Airbnb for a place but not booking.

#### But what are the users on all those devices doing during the sessions? The data provides information on 3 important actions: searching, sending messages, and requesting a booking

What's actually interesting is to see how user actions translate into user outcomes. Below is a high level summary of users' average session durations, days online, and achieved user outcomes:

 #### Most of the people as from the last graph show that will chat to the host of the place and then only seem to book it.

# Analysis 2
### In the 2nd Analysis, I am trying to find out if there are any preferences related to travelling based upon gender.

#### It can be seen from the below grapg that there is a lot of data missing which means people have not specified there gender while signing up at Airnb.
 #### Also, notice that there is a slight difference between user gender.

#### Next thing it might be interesting to see if there is any gender preferences when travelling:

#### There are no big differences between the 2 main genders, but there is destination frecuency of the countries. It is furthere explined in the next graph which is in general where most of the people have made there bookings.

#### The first thing we can see that if there is a reservation, it's likely to be inside the US. But there is a 45% of people that never did a reservation.

#### Going further to see what is the main age which prefers travelling.

#### The common age to travel is between 25 and 40. 

#### The next graph help us identify is there is a preference in travelling destination related to age.Like if people above 45 travel in a different way.

# Analysis 3

### There are many devices which are used by users to sign up. 

#### In Analysis 3, I have tried to show which are the devices which are mostly used by users to sign up on Airbnb and do their booking or just search for a detination. The dataset provides with the information where and when have the devices been used.

![ana3_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25597919/25309793/8b1d4bac-27a4-11e7-8ec5-e3da1b4cee59.JPG)

#### Here it can be seen that most of the users have used either used Chrome or Safari as their browsers to sign up compared to other methods

#### Going further to see what are devices that have been used by used to sign up or make their bookings.

### From the graph it is eveident that most of the users have used either windows, iOS or Andrroid as their sign up devices.
But their has been a significant increase in the users who have used mobile phone to sign up and there has been a reduction in people using desktop more.
