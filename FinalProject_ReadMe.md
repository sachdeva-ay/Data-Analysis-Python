# Analysis 1

#### Using **AirBnb** User Sessions Dataset, in the first Analysis 1 have tried and showed how users do the activities after creating an account. 

#### I have converted a .txt file to a csv datafile for a cleaner look. The data set provides with information for when was the account created, which device wwas used, if there was a booking done or if the user just did some searching but did not book.
#### It also shows how many time the user has visited the site and for how many minuted hat particular session lasted and what were his activities during that.
